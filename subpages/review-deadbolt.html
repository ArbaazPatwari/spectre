          <h3>Deadbolt is a 2D side-scrolling stealth-based pixel art shooter...</h3>
          <p>
            And it silently guides you to become an efficient assassin. In this game you play as a Reaper, employed by the Flames to cull
            the undead. They live miserably in a state of limbo and also cause trouble in the world, requiring their dispatchment. Zombies,
            vampires, skeletons, and demons wander the Place, and even form groups led by undead gang leaders. Observe the enemy movements
            within rooms, flick off the lights to hide, turn to smoke and zip through vent shafts. Explore possible routes and techniques to
            complete the challenging levels, to get the best score and time. Be careful above all else, for the Reaper dies in one, fleeting shot.
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is tactical and offers moments of celerity. Enemies are quick to react, so you must find how and where to hit them first.
            The darkness can be used to conceal you, so lights can be shot. Doors can be knocked on to distract nearby enemies, and you can evade
            them by using vents in the buildings. There's some creativity in the way each level can be completed, but not plenteous. Enemy walk 
            and guard routines are fairly robotic, and while there is some randomness for the distance they travel, the game feels based on timing
            and not skill or techniques. Levels are short to play and the game is only a couple of hours long at most. It offers a level editor which 
            is a fun feature. There are a handful of guns to acquire but my gripe is that you can only use two for the mission and the rest are locked,
            even though you own them. 
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            The graphics are quite simplistic, and there is some detail to levels, but nothing impressive. I like how there is a story crafted for this
            game, with snippets of lore and background information about the factions. Something that I find interesting is the dynamic gore system, where 
            blood splatters on the walls are splodgy and creates a distinct gruesome style for this game. The soundtrack is nice which blends rock with jazz 
            themes and even disco or metal tones depending on the song. Light is an important presence to consider in the way each level is played - whether
            you want to lure enemies somewhere or to sneak up on them. I think some of the particle effects like fire and dust sparkles are a bit mesmerising. 
            A nice touch is how your room gets improved over the course of the game, as you become a more successful Reaper.
          </p>
