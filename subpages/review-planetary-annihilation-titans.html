          <h3>Planetary Annihilation: Titans is a third person futuristic RTS war game... </h3>
          <p>
            And it wages it on an unbelievable scale. In this game you play as a Commander, a huge robot equipped with AI that calculates 
            strategies for war. In future star systems, after humanity has died out, their robot creations separated by faction wake from
            dormancy; their search for battle continues. Each team mines for metal and produces energy to craft the best units, ranging from
            aerial, ground, naval, and orbital types. Massive armies of tanks, bombers, bots, scouts, heavy infrantry and even planet-razing 
            titans are at your command. There are also defences for your bases and front lines like turrets and umbrellas which are anti-orbital
            defences.  
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is chaotic and tense, each side has to grow their forces at a breakneck pace otherwise one will become dominated by the
            other. It's important to generate enough energy and metal for building and sustaining active units, but economy has to be balanced
            simultaneously or production speed will plummet. There is a good varety of units to pick from, even advanced ones if you have the 
            resources. I think there can be too many things to manage at times so it asks for the user's skill of micromanagement. The playerbase 
            is small so getting a full multiplayer match will take a few minutes. The controls may feel a little janky, but there is a lot of depth
            in how you produce and direct units which is good to see. Using Titans on your enemy is really awesome.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            The game's vehicles have a simple construction and detail, but this isn't an issue because when zoomed out only their icons will 
            be visible as they are tiny compared to the planets and moons they traverse. The environments are very plain which I think could use a
            few extra assets but on the other hand the battles are the focal point of the game. The soundtrack is orchestral and epic, sometimes 
            a dramatic song will trigger in a calm situation which can be amusing. The overall sound design is good to differentiate between selected
            vehicles and interactions. The game's performance isn't great and is guaranteed to stutter when many characters are visible.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Lots of vehicles</li>
            <li>Crazy set pieces, scenarios</li>
            <li>Online multiplayer</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Poor performance</li>
            <li>Small playerbase</li>
            <li>Bland planets</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Planetary Annihilation: Titans is a crazy game amped up by the mega machines and planets at your disposal. I score it 7/10.</p>
