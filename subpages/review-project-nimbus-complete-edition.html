          <h3>Project Nimbus: Complete Edition is a third person singleplayer aerial mecha combat game...</h3>
          <p>
            And it's surreal to paint the sky with fire. Project Nimbus is a game about flying battle frames in a future Earth, and fighting
            for the different factions that now remain after the last great war. The surface of the Earth became ruined and unsuitable to support
            humanity, so flying cities and orbital elevators were made to sustain life. Story missions see you team up in a squad or fight a 
            military base alone as you play from the perspective of characters in these factions. Skirmishes are fought in the skies in a variety
            of mecha types, which can be unlocked in a PvE mode and upgraded aside from the campaign.
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is speedy and cool, flying and boosting to the enemy and unleashing hundreds of bullets or homing missiles is a blast.
            The missions take you to various locations which all feel expansive yet sparse, but since the mecha are large, the buildings and infrastructure 
            are smaller than expected and not very detailed which is disappointing. The controls feel a little jagged but there is a lot of 
            directional control and plenty of weapons to experience. The PvE warfront mode is nice, its pace and scenarios can be bland but if you 
            enjoy the combat it feels great, and upgrades are always a plus. Manually locking on to enemies and getting to close range is lengthy 
            but I got used to these nuances. It is quite annoying though when a lone enmy keeps running away and I have to chase them for kilometres.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            There are cool smoke, explosion, and lighting effects that create a cinematic and powerful feel. There are a bunch of different frames 
            and even one that transforms, all with their own feel. I didn't like how the story kept jumping between perspectives as it made
            the story confusing, and difficult to root for a certain character because they are set against the other characters. The music
            is orchestral and heroic. The HUD is ok, as are the mission briefings, but the weapons would benefit from auto-reloading. The voice
            acting sounds good but definitely exaggerated and there are no playback controls for audio logs. Also, the battle frame's own callouts 
            for readied weapons can be loud and redundant.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Great aerial combat</li>
            <li>Nice music</li>
            <li>Cool locations</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Level design mediocre</li>
            <li>Confusing story</li>
            <li>Sometimes buggy enemies</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Project Nimbus: Complete Edition is a thrill of a mecha combat game that is quite engaging. I score it 7/10.</p>
