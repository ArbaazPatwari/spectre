          <h3>Override: Mech City Brawl is a third person large-scale beat 'em up...</h3>
          <p>
            And you punch big robots with your big robot. In this game you control a massive mech, each equipped with a cool moveset to battle 
            enemy mechs or aliens called Xenotypes. One day, giant monsters arrive and ravage the cities and landscape. A member of the Mech 
            League Fighters is called in to quell the enemy threat, which sees them through combat missions in maps across the globe. Gain buffs 
            as rewards during the campaign, and earn credits to buy cosmetics and add personality. Use powerful and unique special attacks to batter 
            the enemy, or go all in with one supercharged blow.
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is quite polished and awesome, as there are a large variety of moves to pull off. The timing of attacks is something to
            get used to, but after this hurdle fighting will feel more fluid and manageable. Even once you are knocked to the ground, there
            is a quick get-up move which is great for extending the flow in a fight. However, it was lengthy or not possible to find a multiplayer 
            match since the playerbase is so small. Attacking will charge up a specials meter which allows you to pull off cool tricks with flashy 
            moves, like Rocca's rocket punch. One cool feature is when doing local co-op, each player can control a mech part for up to four people
            which sounds wacky and funny. Apart from the decent variety of characters and moves, the game doesn't offer much in terms of progression,
            just some cosmetics. It would benefit from more maps or other gamemodes. It is cool to see the destruction though as much as I want to
            protect the cities.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            The game looks quite fun with bright colours and vivid visual effects cast everywhere. The characters move too fast to grasp a sense
            of their scale and weight, but there are some thumps when they walk which is good to hear. The campaign mode is nice but quite basic
            and just involves exterminations with no other objectives to keep things interesting. The city designs are cool and the mechs are
            colourful but not intricately detailed. Some songs in the soundtrack are heroic, especially the menu music. 
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Extensive moveset</li>
            <li>Variety of characters</li>
            <li>Good sound design</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Dead playerbase</li>
            <li>Basic mech customisation</li>
            <li>Overpriced</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Override: Mech City Brawl is a giant mech combat game that is too shallow to match its fun factor. I score it 6/10.</p>
