          <h3>Titanfall 2 is a first person futuristic high octane shooter with mechs...</h3>
          <p>
            And I really love mechs. In Titanfall 2 you play as pilot Jack Cooper, a member of the Militia sent on a combat mission to 
            the IMC controlled planet Typhon. Facing heavy retaliation from its defences, the Militia struggle to advance and are scattered
            across the planet. Cooper meets his mentor and assumes control of the Titan called BT-7274, and they travel huge distances to 
            regroup with their forces. The synergy between the two is great, fighting enemies separately, or battling as one. You get to see 
            diverse environments and use powerful future weapons to quell IMC units, and become stronger as a team.
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is fluid and energetic; you can duck to cover or speed towards your foes while doing parkour to dodge their attacks.
            A host of tactical abilities can get you through tricky situations in the campaign and increase your effectiveness in multiplayer matches.
            However, there are some issues with Titanfall 2 like the spotty servers. It's been a fairly long time since release, and Respawn
            Entertainment are focusing on other titles like Apex, but the servers close to me continually spike in ping which leads to me
            jumping back and forth as a rubber band. This is a blow to my multiplayer experience but maybe it's my internet (haven't seen
            this calibre of issue with other multiplayer games). When it works though, it's an awesome scale of battle with nimble soldiers
            and huge machines.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            The environments are really cool and exotic in Titanfall 2. There are levels with alien nature, facilities of different kinds, and 
            varied objectives in each chapter which keeps you on your toes. The weapons are detailed and cool looking, they have smooth but slightly exaggerated 
            animations (produced by an animator called 'Hyper' on YouTube). Even the Titans get their own weapons and abilities. The cockpit movement and 
            loud stomps emulate the feel of being in a mech. The soundtrack is quite good and spectacles are produced nicely with 
            good foreground lighting and particle effects, and layered on are other visual effects and art. The scenarios and set pieces
            are cleverly done and make this game a joy to play.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Very fluid fps combat</li>
            <li>Epic scale with Titans</li>
            <li>Great campaign</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Slow servers</li>
            <li>Long matchmaking times</li>
            <li>Very grindy for skins</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Titanfall 2 is a swift and totally metal action shooter. I score it 9/10.</p>
