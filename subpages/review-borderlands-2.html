          <h3>Borderlands 2 is a first person action RPG looter shooter...</h3>
          <p>
            And it offers plenty of content with a well-made campaign. The main story focuses around the tale of a Vault Hunter, a special type
            of explorer with a knack for combat and a thirst for treasure. On the planet of Pandora lies a Vault wherein kept are rumoured extremely
            valuable items. However, a slew of crazy psychos, bandits, skags, loaders, and other nasties that threaten anyone passing by. Take aim 
            and defeat plentiful mobs for gun and shield drops. Compare stats with new gear and improve your arsenal with the most potent equipment. 
            After levelling, you can spend skill points into a tree with powerful passive traits and active abilities for use in battle. Another
            bonus is the abundance of crude and unusual humour which can lift the mood.
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is smooth and compelling, shooting groups of enemies to get money and drops feels gratifying, especially when each piece lights up in 
            colours to identify the loot type. Some arenas and sections can be difficult, especially if you are underlevelled while playing the main story. 
            This is where farming comes into the mix, by returning to areas and also concluding side missions you can be rewarded in cash or a special item. 
            It also feels cyclical to restock on ammo, sell junk weapons for money, and spend skill points, before heading out on another loot run. This also makes
            the game feel repetitive and strength comes incrementally. The gunplay feels nice and there are several weapon manufacturers who craft guns with 
            certain characteristics like Tediore for explosive reloads (like a grenade), Maliwan for elemental damage. If you manage to gather some Eridium - 
            a premium currency, you may use it to upgrade maximum ammo capacity or backpack space (essential!). The respawn stations, fast travel, and second winds 
            are very helpful for the gameplay loop and keeps the action going.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            I quite enjoyed the campaign and story, you get to meet wild and eccentric characters that ally with you, visit unique expansive areas across the 
            planet, fight strong bosses too. The game looks distinct and cool with its cartoony comic-book style art. The aesthetic is good but sometimes lighting
            is dim and textures are a little bland. I can't remember much about the soundtrack since I played this game so long ago (actually featured it first on my 
            YouTube channel), but there are wild western twangs and electronic twists to various instruments. Around you are mad enemies with different agendas like 
            turning you into their shiny new meat bicycle, or claim their immortality as they rush you. The jokes and some dialogue are sometimes excessive and not 
            always my style though. On that note there's plenty of quality voice acting from allies and villains in cutscenes or in missions which presents a mark of 
            quality. Overall, there's a lot of polish, smooth animations, and detailed gun noises. 
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Huge replay value</li>
            <li>Local and online coop</li>
            <li>Variety of weaponry</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Some bosses overpowered</li>
            <li>Limited character customisation</li>
            <li>Level loads before textures ready</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Borderlands 2 is an entertaining and addictive action RPG with gazillions of guns and looty shooty carnage. I score it 8/10.</p>
