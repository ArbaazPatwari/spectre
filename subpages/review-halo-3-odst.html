          <h3>Halo 3 ODST is a first person sci-fi slow-paced story-based shooter...</h3>
          <p>
            And you see the battlefield as each member of the squad. In New Mombasa, a city on Earth, a team of Orbital Drop Shock Troopers
            are deployed to repel the invading Covenant forces (Buck, Dutch, Romeo, Mickey, Rookie). Before they land, a slipspace jump from a nearby Covenant ship 
            falters their course and they end up scattered from their drop point. Alone, they need to regroup and take out as many Covenant as possible.
            Fight across city streets, zoos, and military bases in this adventure, use human and Covenant weapons to your advantage. The city
            is aware, due to a superintendent-class AI that manages traffic systems and other infrastructure, maybe it can be help you on your way. 
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is neat and energetic, roaming through the levels and using unique and familiar weapons to batter the Covenant with is always fun, 
            just this time it's performed by elite soldiers than genetically modified, heavily armoured Spartans. The chapters are lengthy and there are some 
            story cutscenes to break up the action or travelling. There is a map and objective menu to guide you through the levels. There aren't any armour 
            abilities to use, but you can still pick up a plasma cannon or minigun for extra firepower. There are vehicle sections which add some excitement
            to the flow, but I found that the game felt more humble than spectacular. Just like Reach though, I think it is an interesting and thoughtful 
            take on the Halo game series compared to the main ones.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            There are varied environments like a zoo, ONI base, subway system, and rooftops to explore. The colours can be generally washed out and grey,
            but flashing lights, scattered vehicle debris, and cool building structures can set the scene for New Mombasa. The gunplay feels good, but the HUD
            is more sparse without a radar and active ability shown. The sound effects are nice and the music has a remixed feel, even some jazz additions. It's 
            also cool to sometimes hear character comments during a skirmish. Sometimes you can find extra lore from terminals about a side story within the city. 
            Occasionally I like to flick night vision on and off to scan for enemy outlines, which is one of my gamer habits if I am presented with it.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Interesting campaign</li>
            <li>Firefight mode (haven't tried)</li>
            <li>Nice music and ambience effects</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Some sections are dull</li>
            <li>No abilities</li>
            <li>Not amazing graphics</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Halo 3: ODST is a creative sci-fi shooter which balances raging battle fronts against the sombre night streets. I score it 7/10.</p>
