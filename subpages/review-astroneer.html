          <h3>Astroneer is an third person open world space exploration game...</h3>
          <p>
            And it feels minimalistic and easy-going. In this game you play as an Astroneer, an astronaut of the future with the task to
            explore distant worlds and discover the mysteries of the universe. It is an interplanetary sandbox affair, where you can gather
            resources from the surface or underground in various biomes. Raw resources can be refined, and some can be combined to make composite
            materials. These help you build machines and structures for your base, but many require power. Harness the available wind and solar
            energy with turbines and panels, respectively. If you're prepared enough, you can build a shuttle to travel to other planets in the
            star system. (On a side note, I don't know why but my EXO Request Platform Astroneer video tallies the most views on a single video I've 
            uploaded).
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is quite peaceful and slow-paced. There are no enemies to fight, just a simple resource gathering and base building 
            gameplay loop; as far as I remember the only ways of dying were being targeted by some harmful plants, fall damage, oxygen loss. 
            The inventory/ backpack management is quite fun when it centers to the screen when focused, and items move around in a quick but floaty
            way when dragged. Something a bit tiring was the need for oxygen tethers every few metres, while their range is alright you need them to even 
            explore. I suppose it's an easy solution for hospitable planets. I never found battery issues since I'd build generous amounts of 
            wind turbines and solar panels for my base and backpack. Collecting resources is quite satisfying, I found drilling fun but terrain building 
            difficult, also high level drills are required for certain types of rock. The game had some unique broken structures in the wild but landscapes are
            mostly plain, with resources deposits, shrubbery, mountains, and caverns. This probably sounds closed-minded but I prefer combat-based 
            games rather than resource management.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            The game looks pretty, and colours are soft. I like how interacting with items using the cursor provides clicking sound effects, and also
            snap nicely, if perhaps strongly, to tiles in the backpack or power cables connecting to ports. Controlling the character is a bit weird a I think the camera 
            can move independent of the cursor, which allows greater freedom of control but I have no muscle memory for it. The ambient soundtrack in the
            background is thematic but forgetful. I didn't really understand the objective (there isn't really one - which is fine for a sandbox game) but 
            I did like trying new things out. I remember it was necessary to have the worklight when going to dark areas because the suit headlights were 
            not very useful for visibility. I liked how cables and gauges lit up to indicate where oxygen or electricity was flowing through. Materials 
            have interestingly shaped formations, and it's convenient they pack into stacks when mined. When they are inserted as reactants in a furnace, they 
            visually diminish which is a great indicator of quantity. I remember waypoints being awkward and I couldn't find my home base at one point after 
            venturing out.
