          <h3>Nuclear Throne is a 2D top-down post-apocalyptic difficult bullet hell game...</h3>
          <p>
            And it can get completely mental in a heartbeat. In this game you play as one of the survivors in a nuclear post apocalypse.
            Humanity died out, but life on Earth was changed. Robots, plants, and people all were converted into monsters and creatures.
            Fighting broke out every day, to survive was a struggle and you either dealt accepted each passing day or sought for change.
            The mutants must fight their way to reach the Nuclear Throne, for it is said once sat on the world will stabilise. Ever level
            comes with groups of unpredictable and strong enemies to defeat, level up and pick mutations to make you stronger, utilise the
            hundred guns to your advantage and learn from your deaths.
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is always tough but there are few controls, so predominantly timing and aim are essential in staying alive. Enemies 
            can kill you in 1 to 3 hits so death comes easy. It can take many hours to grasp the flow of the game and reach the end, and the 
            relief is brilliant once that happens but the struggle is real. Dodging and shooting has to be done at the same time so multitasking 
            is essential. Mutations can be powerful so pick them wisely, but being greedy for rads can cause premature failure. Shooting feels 
            ok but guns aren't always accurate so it may feel like a shot should land but it doesn't. I would say the difficulty retracts 
            from the fun much of the time and a high level of concentration is needed to avoid all the projectiles flying on screen. Getting
            past the hurdle of the enemies grants satisfaction and can be invigorating.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            The game does look aged blocky characters but each mob and mutant has a variety of animations that bring more liveliness and
            sophistication to the game. The frame rate is locked to 30 fps where all the game's maths and mechanics are tied to, this
            makes the game look lower budget and stuttery a bit. Another visual design choice was the 4:3 aspect ratio for the game which
            was surprising at first, but was done to focus the player view more equally between the vertical and horizontal axes as enemies come
            from all directions. The soundtrack is styled and cool with the harmonica, it can get repetitive as you replay the levels but 
            the theme is distinct and fitting for each. There isn't a campaign but snippets of tips and character information are provided in
            the level loading screens which describes the world.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Lots of weapons</li>
            <li>Replay value</li>
            <li>Variety of characters and mutations</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Questionably difficult</li>
            <li>No other gamemodes</li>
            <li>Basic art and effects</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Nuclear Throne is a challenging game that entices the player to save the wasteland. I score it 7/10.</p>
