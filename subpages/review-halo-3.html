          <h3>Halo 3 is a first person sci-fi grand story-driven shooter...</h3>
          <p>
            And it is an exciting, empowering Halo to experience. In this game you play as The Master Chief, with a mission to end
            the Human-Covenant war that has been troubling the galaxy. Clear the way in east Africa to defend Earth from Covenant 
            attackers, and stop them from activating all the Halo rings by reaching the Ark, the birthplace of the rings, before they succeed.
            Since Cortana was stranded from the previous game, Chief goes with the Arbiter and marines to stop the Covenant enacting their fanatic 
            duties be it through the jungle, bases, highways, and Forerunner installations. Use abilities and big guns to your advantage, ride various
            vehicles, and slash through foes like butter with an energy sword.
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The game feels well-paced and occasionally thrilling, with impressive cutscene moments and fun missions in expansive environments,
            there is a lot to like. With some verticality, linear corridors, and open air, the game takes you to many battlefields which are structured
            well throughout. There are a variety of enemies and factions to fight which keeps things fresh. Some travelling in the game can be dragged out
            but it's not bad, especially when compared with the earlier Halos in my opinion. There is an option to dual wield weapons which is good
            for increasing dps but I am not comfortable with that playstyle overall. There's also multiplayer for crazy, customised matches, and abilities 
            like a bubble shield for camp- I mean protecting your rear. I felt that there were a couple of unnecessarily rough sections so I overprepared 
            when facing certain enemies to wipe them on the floor with a fuel rod cannon or barrage of grenades before Chief got downed (every Halo has 
            some of these scenarios).
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            The soundtrack is really good in this game, it gets heroic and spirited which makes being a Spartan feel awesome. Like the other Halos,
            sound effects like explosions and shooting are good, and the cutscenes are quite enjoyable to watch. I don't really like the sporadic 
            Cortana flashbacks which are distracting but there are only a few of them. There are picturesque backgrounds and interesting structures to
            scale while fighting. Some of the open ground sections like near the highway or desert are dull looking but the story continues straight after.
            Going to vastly different locations over the campaign can make following the story confusing, and I found that the graphics and textures were ok 
            but not great.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Thrilling campaign</li>
            <li>Great soundtrack</li>
            <li>Multiplayer mode</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Mediocre graphics</li>
            <li>Annoying flashbacks</li>

          </ul>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Halo 3 is a sci-fi shooter with a lot of cool moments and quintessential Halo vibes. I score it 8/10.</p>
