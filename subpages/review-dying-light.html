          <h3>Dying Light is a first person parkour-driven survival horror zombie game...</h3>
          <p>
            And it feels satisfying to chop those mobs in two. In this game you play as Kyle Crane, a soldier-turned mercenary hired by the 
            Global Relief Effort on a mission to the infected fictional city of Harran. A terrible virus has broken out, and turned many 
            civilians into violent flesh-eating zombies. As such, the city was cordoned off from the world and occasional supply drops are 
            sent to aid suvivors in the city. However, there are rebel factions and an evil leader with a file containing a highly toxic incomplete
            cure for the virus - threatening to leak this to the world. You must stop this from happening and survive long enough in this tough environment to
            do so. Gather materials to craft strong weapons, and gain xp from kills to improve your skills and abilities. Embrace a rocky adventure and be 
            immersed in the cool world the developers have created. Did I mention there's plenty of parkour to get you going?
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay can range from relaxing to exhilarating, creeping through the streets, looting buildings, taking out zombies feels quite 
            realistic for an apocalyptic scenario. Weapon durability provides an incentive to upgrade weapons, maximising their usefulness. Weapons
            can be upgraded to do fire or electric damage; guns can even be used but they attract plenty of attention. The game also has its wacky side, 
            with some odd side quests and regular events where you can have super strength and send zombies flying over the whole nine yards. What is 
            admirable is that the game was supported for 7 years after release and there were frequent community events throughout. There is lots of
            to explore, and you can take others along in co-op mode. There is a lot of DLC content, including The Following expansion which adds buggies
            and a new map. Where there is great danger comes greater rewards - should you venture out at night you will gain more xp than usual, but zombies
            will become faster and more aggressive. And should you ever come face to face with a volatile... let out your final scream.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            I really dig the vibe of this game, the layout of the city, buildings, and structures means there are plenty of options to do parkour, and
            without the people it felt like a husk of a place. I was reading that Harran is a fictional Middle-Eastern city ispired by Istanbul and Mumbai which
            is cool. The soundtrack is electronic and vocal at parts, sometimes it sounds uneasy or menacing which is thematic. The slashing of blades, splattering
            of guts and limbs, and the guttural roars of the zombies are great. There are some of visual effects and sounds of the world which create a special 
            ambience for this dying place. There is a lot of dialogue which is engaging for the player, also some empowering and disheartening moments in the story that
            are memorable. The map is quite simplistic, so getting to locations is easier than getting lost. I find the graphics to be good, with lots of play with lighting
            in different areas, but some zombie animations look glitchy and not perfect as they occasionally clip through objects.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
