          <h3>Monster Hunter: World is a third person fantasy hack and slash RPG...</h3>
          <p>
            And it never fails to get your blood pumping. In this game you play as a Hunter, who is affiliated with the Fifth Fleet, on a  
            journey to the New World to study its creatures and an event called the Elder Crossing. The latest Elder Dragon to undertake 
            this passage is Zorah Magdaros which crashes into the ship the fleet were sailing in. After setting the base in Astera, the Hunter
            their Handler and Palico, a cool supportive cat, explore the regions of the New World and tackle ravenous monsters who threaten
            the ecosystem. Defeat monsters and gather resources to build cool armour and strong weapons. Craft traps and potions to shift the
            fights in your favour and eat cooked meals for a mighty boost of morale and strength.
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is strategic and exhilarating, going toe to toe with huge beasts using ridiculously sized weapons shouldn't make
            sense but the feeling it produces is awesome. Monsters come in various classes and sizes, and there are even super strong
            Elder Dragons that give you rare resources. It's fun to test weapons and learn the combos, then executing them in a battle 
            to become victorious. Sometimes grinding for a certain material is dull and also the fights can become time-consuming, especially
            if you are underequipped. There is a learning curve to each weapon but once each is grasped you can gain ground against these
            huge beasts. If you are trying to track or engage a monster, it can be annoying when they run across the whole map, because the Hunter
            takes a while to catch up. Monsters can be difficult but ultimately it's about learning attack patterns and doing damage where possible.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            The combination of medieval, fantasy, steampunk, hunter-gatherer themes which builds for a cool world and its characters, clothing, 
            weapons, UI. The sound design is very good which creates these immersive environments. I like a lot of the male and female armours 
            in the game and they are quite detailed, some are odd though. The maps are scenic and my favourite one is the Ancient Forest, you 
            can even do fishing and cook steak, where edible items can be consumed for health or stamina, but some are decorative for your room.
            The soundtrack is orchestral and heroic, with many tracks and themes being memorable I think it is well done.
          </p>
