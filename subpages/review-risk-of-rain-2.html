          <h3>Risk of Rain 2 is a third person sci-fi roguelike looter shooter...</h3>
          <p>
            And it feels addictive when you get all the items. In this game you play as a survivor, on a rescue mission aboard the UES Safe Travels
            to find any lost people and cargo from the disappearance of the UES Contact Light. After communication with that cargo ship went
            dark years ago, the crew are led to a mysterious planet in the middle of nowhere and find themselves greeted with hosility by
            its alien inhabitants. Collect blades, energy drinks, and teddies in order to beat them back and escape. These objects will grant status
            effects that can help the player, and getting more of the same will increase the effect. Repair drones and activate use-items for
            a significant power up. 
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is satisfying and invigorating, when you acquire items you can create a build for your character to heal constantly,
            or do fire damage, or buff your speed. The combinations and possibilities of item combinations are myriad; the game allows
            the player choice in what they would like to get. Be warned, as when time increases, so does the difficulty so it is up to the 
            gamer to decide the risk of staying on a level. I feel like you can die for no reason sometimes after a strong attack or be 
            weaker than ideal, but this is partly RNG which can make things fresh but is plenty unfair. Characters have different skills and 
            unlockable ones so there is a variety of playstyles to choose from. Risk of Rain 2 offers lots of replay value but easily gets
            tedious.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            The game's graphics are simple, and each environment has a certain shape and verticality. They are often quite sparse and simple,
            but the action and objectives are where the focus is. Each item acts cosmetically when obtained which is clever and looks absolutely
            crazy after a while. The colours and shapes make abilities and effects from each item easy to recognise, there are also audio cues
            for telegraphed enemy attacks which is useful to pay attention to. The soundtrack is very spacey and thematic for each level. If 
            you are brave enough (or slap on a certain command artifact like me), special skins can be unlocked for reaching an ending on Monsoon
            difficulty. If you manage to survive a long time, your screen will fill with chaos and flying bodies and explosions. 
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Huge replay value</li>
            <li>Numerous items and lore snippets</li>
            <li>Online multiplayer</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Can get repetitive</li>
            <li>Some items challenge-locked (difficult)</li>
            <li>More stressful than relaxing</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Risk of Rain 2 is an addictive game that portrays part-time hoarder vs angry alien mob. I score it 8/10.</p>
