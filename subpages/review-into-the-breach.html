          <h3>Into the Breach is a 2D isometric time-travelling turn-based strategy game...</h3>
          <p>
            And it cleverly forgives you for making mishaps. In Into the Breach you control a team of mech pilots, sent back in time to another
            timeline to save humanity from the global threat that the giant bug monster, the Vek, pose. The goal is to succeed in each timeline
            (run), and save many lives while exterminating the monsters swarming each island. Use a variety of tactics and different mech classes 
            to battle the Vek, and equip different weapons to gain victory in a battle. If too much damage occurs to the power grid then the world
            will be lost and the pilots forced to withdraw, with the chance that they can rescue another Earth. 
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is neat and compelling, each move the player makes can bring satisfaction or pain, but compromises and risks must be taken
            for the most useful outcome like saving a mech rather than a time pod, or saving a civilian building over a relic. The playing field is
            a small 8 by 8 grid but fighting enemies can be daunting when they outnumber you. The player is also given 'perfect information' where
            they can see the order of enemy attacks, which helps plan for better moves. After each island is saved you can spend reputation on new
            weapons or buy more grid power which is nice to tip the odds in your favour. There are several game difficulties where the only repercussion
            is final score (and number of nasties you have to face) - so play your way. Different mech teams can be bought with in-game currency and 
            randomised which leads to funky builds. If a level goes wrong, you can undo a move, or reset the playing field once.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            The colours and pixel graphics are nice to look at, and the UI is nicely designed; it isn't too cluttered or intrusive on the gameplay.
            The soundtrack is good and completing an island triggers the main theme which is nice. There are a large number of level types, filled with 
            building, mountain, or ice tiles for example. Some of these obstructions can be useful in completing objectives, there are even trains, satellites
            and terraformers involved in missions. The gameplay speed can be increased if desired, and there are some accessiblity features like font 
            size increase and screen shake disabling. The sound design is good and there are some cool environment hazards in the game.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>High replay value</li>
            <li>Plenty of content</li>
            <li>Cool missions</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Only 5 islands (maps)</li>
            <li>Game can feel punishing</li>
            <li>Tough challenges</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Into the Breach is a robust strategy game with mechs and other surprises. I score it 7/10.</p>
