          <h3>Halo 4 is a first person sci-fi epic story-based shooter...</h3>
          <p>
            And it brings some new enemies and weapons into the Halo mix. Play as Master Chief, guided by Cortana on the ancient Forerunner
            world of Requiem. After drifting through space, the planet's gravity causes him to crash land, but here an ancient threat looms. 
            A mysterious signal leads them to learn about the Forerunners and one of their leaders who is extremely dangerous and wants to wipe
            out humanity. Additionally, Cortana is becoming rampant and Chief needs to find a way to save her. Use devastating new weapons like the SAW
            or Binary Rifle to obliterate foes, and ride the all-new Mantis to overpower enemies with bullets, rockets, and stomps.
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is smooth and well paced, ducking for cover when reloading or healing, and there are weapons that enemies drop or
            various firearms placed around each section to let the player pick their preference to exterminate the enemy with. I think the 
            Forerunner enemies were an interesting new addition, but can be frustrating to hit as they move weirdly. Sometimes it is easy to get swarmed
            or overwhelmed, but this can be an opportunity to switch up tactics. I like the vehicle sections of the game as they can be a nice treat
            after mostly running and shooting. In that regard the game can get boring, but the story cutscenes and dialogue can be quite captivating generally.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            I think the levels and environments had diverse features, layouts, and background art. This contrasts with the looming and repetitive levels
            in earlier Halos in my opinion, granting for more interesting and engaging missions. Furthermore, it makes the game well-travelled in the sense
            the player gets to experience an alien world, new UNSC vehicles and rooms, going through the jungle, and flying missions including a rail shooter segment.
            I think the soundtrack can be inspiring and the game's gun sounds are great. Sometimes the levels can be quite long especially when you do multiple 
            tries after a difficult section. It is a shame that it didn't have firefight though, which was very cool in Halo: Reach.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Solid Gameplay</li>
            <li>Cool vehicles (especially Mantis)</li>
            <li>Intriguing environments</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Unfair situations</li>
            <li>No Firefight mode</li>
            <li>Missions can be long</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Halo 4 is a great space shooter which provides new gun, equipment, vehicle additions, and is a compelling play. I score it 8/10.</p>
