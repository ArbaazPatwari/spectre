          <h3>Dead Cells is a 2D side-scrolling Medtroidvania pixel art hack and slash...</h3>
          <p>
            And it is largely a pretty and performant title. In Dead Cells you play as The Beheaded, an immortal blob with the ability to control
            and reanimate corpses to get around the island. A dreadful sickness called the Malaise has infected the living, either leaving them seriously 
            ill before death or turning them into undead monsters. In order to seek answers and change the outcome of the contaminated island, it hunts
            the King. Travel through colourful and intricate environments, use various weapons like swords and crossbows to defeat enemies, gain money for 
            upgrading your gear and certain mutations can be picked to grant buffs. Cells collected from killing enemies can be used to unlock weapons and 
            outfits permanently across runs. (I have only played the mobile version as of yet, which is a port of the same PC game with some optimisations and
            accessibility features like auto-hitting which makes gameplay easier on mobile).
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is frantic and fluid, rolling off ledges and slamming down on enemies seems like a dance when enacted. This game is a roguelite so 
            each run will permit use of unlocked items from the previous runs, bought using Cells which are an important currency in the game. There are 
            plenty of enemy types to go up against and sizeable maps, where you have the option to sprint through them or to engage foes methodically to 
            preserve health. There is a lot of verticality where you can climb chains or platforms for downward smashes or dropping bombs. I like the huge 
            variety of weapons and items to use, so you can build a loadout that feels fun and strong. A small minimap shows your location in a level and 
            nearby teleporters which are a huge convenience for returning to certain places. I like the layout and distinct setting each level provides, and 
            you have a small choice in the next map you want to play after beating a level. Some levels can be difficult due to exclusive mechanics like bouncing
            barrels or total darkness which I don't really enjoy. There's a bunch of interesting DLC content also but this makes in quite expensive for PC, console, 
            or mobile.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            Scenery is crafted quite well in this game, from vistas to general background decorations, to the particle effects and lighting, this game is delightful
            to look at. Animations of The Beheaded and enemies are produced with an interesting technique - they are modelled and animated in 3D, and rendered and tweaked 
            in 2D as sprites where shaders and VFX are added. This removes the necessity taken to draw sprites by hand. I like the soundtrack which sounds gothic, with
            plenty of vocals, and a mandolin I think. There are some secret rooms and lore snippets that are nice to come across, but the story is not told directly. 
            Outfits can be changed and my favourite is the HEV outfit with a striking orange and black palette. Sometimes during fights the screen can be overpopulated 
            with objects/ flashing effects, which can be distracting. It's good that enemies telegraph their attacks but some are incredibly short so you'd have to watch out. 
            A nice touch is that you can change the appearance of healing items labelled 'diet' in the settings which is purely cosmetic but quite fun - choose between 
            carnivore, vegetarian, monster, fruitarian, castlevaniesque, baguette, half-life, cheese.
          </p>
