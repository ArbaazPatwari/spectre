          <h3>Subsurface Circular is a third person robotic singleplayer text-based adventure...</h3>
          <p>
            And it's completely underground. In this game you play as a Tek, more specifically a detective that travels to different 
            subway stations on the underground network to gather information from passengers. A new snippet of information has risen,
            describing the disappearances of Teks in the city above. Talk to strangers and figure out what they know, learn about the 
            Tek world and the purpose of these robots to gain insight into the problem. Unlock new focus points and solve puzzles 
            for more dialogue.
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is simple and easy-going in Subsurface Circular, the point and click nature and customisable dialogue speed 
            reduces the amount of inputs and distractions the player can sense so they can focus on the story events more. You get to meet
            a variety of different Teks like librarians and fabricators who all have a background and a story to tell about themselves. Except
            listeners, because they are busy with their music and won't even respond to you! The game is quite relaxing and short, where
            you can complete it in one sitting, but the pace is quite slow and toned down which may not satisfy everyone. There are robots 
            everywhere, so if you have automatonophobia it will not be pleasant. I like robots so here I am writing this review.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            The animation style, soft colour palette, and blur effects create a unique and cosy atmosphere in the game world. The train doesn't 
            change but it's exciting to see the new faces at each station or chapter. A boppy electronic soundtrack is a nice accompaniment to
            the flow of the game. The characters don't have voices but communicate to each other via a text channel. I think that's a clever
            concept but on-screen it means a lot of reading for the player. The robot designs are detailed and look cool with their LEDs. The
            UI is simple but arranged with respect to the camera to let the text pop and show the speaking Teks.
          </p>
