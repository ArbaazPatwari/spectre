          <h3>Hydro Thunder Hurricane is a third person high-speed arcade-style boat racer...</h3>
          <p>
            And it feels great to play no matter the weather. A sequel to the original Hydro Thunder by Midway, where you select
            a souped-up boat to race against others in extravagant locations. Aim to get gold in every event which grants the most
            points, and maybe even dinner. Acquire boost to go faster and jump over obstacles, and get in the wake of other boats
            to power through the course. Choose from three classes of boats (Novice, Pro, Expert) for varying challenge as the races
            get harder and the rewards become greater. And if you are adventurous, shiny collectibles can be found hidden in every map.
            (I should disclose that I am bias towards this game as it was quite fun in my childhood).
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is exciting and intense, whether that's in normal races, Ring Masters, Gauntlets, or Championships. Placing
            in the top 3 ranks in any event grants credits which totals cumulatively, unlocking new courses, events, and most importantly
            - boats. Every boat handles differently and the base game with the Tempest DLC there are 11 original boats and 6 expert variants of
            the Novice and Pro boats. One time (twice actually) I unlocked the Banshee X which costs around 200,000 credits which was quite momentous
            for me. Experiment with the amount of power applied to a boat, and how it turns in the water or air. Draft behind other boats
            for a speed boost and utilise the map mechanics to create waves or activate gates. I wish online multiplayer worked on PC though, it would have
            been great to compete with other people. Don't worry too much about crashing because the boat can be reset nearby. Also may I say that the 
            water physics in this game are the best in any game I have played.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            The game is now quite old and the graphics aren't jaw dropping but there is a lot of detail in the boats and the levels look nice. 
            The way the boats transform when you have boost is really cool, and even without the skins they each have a distinct personality.
            A short soundtrack has a variety of funky and electronic sounding upbeat music to complement each race, and although repetitive the
            announcer's phrases are always entertaining. The levels are amazing and sometimes wacky like the Bermuda Triangle or 
            Area 51. My favourite map is Lake Powell as it is a fun and beautiful point to point course. I think the game should have better accessbility/
            visual controls like for screen shake or motion blur because they can become annoying or distracting. I'll never get tired of boost transformations though.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">

          <h3>Cons</h3>

            <li>I wish online multiplayer worked (PC)</li>
            <li>No accessibility controls</li>
            <li>Limited to Xbox/PC</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Hydro Thunder Hurricane is an awesome arcade-style game that nails boat racing and is great for couch co-op. I score it 9/10.</p>
