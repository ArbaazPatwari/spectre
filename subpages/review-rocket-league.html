          <h3>Rocket League is a frantic and frustrating third person online multipler football game...</h3>
          <p>
            And it may be the ride of your life. In Rocket League you play as an RC car with the objective of scoring more points than your
            opponent's team by the time the match ends, imitative of real life football. There are different cars to play and customisations
            to unlock, and multiple maps and gamemodes to spice up each match. After driving for some while skilled players will prefer to
            use tricks and aerials to outmanouver the opponent and gain possession of the ball more. Getting a goal after a long struggle
            gives a rush of excitement that comes from the heart in competitive play.  
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is dynamic and easy to pick up; just drive towards the ball and hit it to the other goal. Except there are more
            extensive combos and the ability to boost, so you can combine jumps and turns to go faster and further than normal. At the right 
            speed you can demolish other cars which is funny but definitely annoying for the receiver. The game doesn't encourage team work
            as much as it is needed, but players can assume attacking or defending roles for their best chance of success. There is a wide 
            skill disparity between new players and veterans which can cause some matches to be a bore as one side is bested, but matchmaking
            is generally ok. There are different gamemodes with powerups that make you feel giddy, and a competitive mode for those looking
            to rank up in the playerspace.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            The maps are distinctive in theme, one with neon lights, one underwater. The playing field is usually a rectangle and there might 
            be a background scene but the levels are not stunning or too detailed - which is fine for this game. The bumpy EDM soundtrack
            complements the game well, and you can skip tracks to your liking. You can put decals on and colour your cars which expresses your
            personality, even the boost trail and speed lines which is a nice touch. There are a lot of cool items but many of them
            are paid DLC content or require a rcoket pass. Reactions or instructions can be relayed to the team with quick chats.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Pick up and play vibe</li>
            <li>Multiple gamemodes</li>
            <li>Great car customisation</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Sometimes toxic players</li>
            <li>Lot of paid content</li>
            <li>Can get repetitive</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Rocket League is a sporty driving game that is fun with friends. I score it 6/10.</p>
