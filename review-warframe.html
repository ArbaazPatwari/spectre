          <h3>Warframe is a third person sci-fi online multiplayer looter shooter...</h3>
          <p>
            And it's probably my favourite game in my entire collection. Where to begin? You play as a Tenno, awoken from a deep slumber,
            thousands of years into the future after the collapse of major civilisations and a major war. The ability to control 
            advanced humanoid battle machines called Warframes is imperative in maintaining peace between the power-hungry factions in 
            the solar system. Fight your enemies, gather resources and xp, elevate yourself to mastery of guns and blades, save up 
            for outfits and dress to kill. Learn about the other Warframes and gain skills to survive.
          </p>
          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay is exciting and fun, doing parkour while shooting, buffing yourself or allies with abilities, making your 
            favourite weapons or frames after gathering enough resources. But it's also Warframe's big flaw. Grinding the same mission
            for a 'chance' (RNG) of the resource you need provides replay value for the player but can be quite dull. It's good to mix up
            playing mission types or burnout is going to happen. Warframe offers a huge amount of content to explore, hundreds of missions,
            even different gamemodes and events to connect the community, but it gets tedious. There's great customisation for modding weapons
            and decorating your characters, but farming for rare items with absurdly low drop rates ruins the fun.
          </p>
          <h3>Audio Visual</h3>
          <p>
            The creative direction is very impressive in Warframe. There are styled levels respective to the feel of each faction, unique
            sounds for the weapons and thrusters on vehicles. The environments have cool objects and set pieces sometimes, there are even
            3 open world maps that are quite impressive to play in. Each Warframe's energy colour can be customised which really brings out flare
            that you can share with others. Syandanas are these cool capes, Ephemeras are these auras of energy, change the look of your orbiter
            or characters to fit a theme. The transforming or lit-up weapons pertain to a futuristic age, and the game feels quite mature
            in its structure and style.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Large playerbase</li>
            <li>Endless customisation</li>
            <li>Lots to do</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul class="square_list">
            <li>Too much grinding and farming</li>
            <li>Some annoying bugs</li>
            <li>Overwhelming amounts of content</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Warframe is a fun and fast sci-fi action game that has something for everyone. I score it 9/10.</p>
