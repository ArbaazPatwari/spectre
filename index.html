        <h3>Hey guys, Arbaaz here...</h3>
        <p class="italic">
          This is a blog/ showcase site serving as an outlet for some creative writing and other projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm an aspiring software engineering student that likes to try new and cool programs, so I can make entertaining 
          and useful things for others. I decided to make this website to further my web development experience and implement
          novel features or have a go at making a polished site. Since this is hosted via GitHub Pages as an early project,
          it will only be a static site and not use back end languages like PHP, but I'll see what I can make of the
          big 3 HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I wanted to produce some written content on the web and considered writing articles
          or making a blog. Although, through coding this site I can include topics I want to talk about, not have to host it through
          a paid service or buy a domain name yet (so the barrier of entry is easy), and I can scrap it if it all goes to- I mean
          lovingly and dearly develop this site. It will probably be minimalistic though, just so I don't get confused with
          all the elements you could possibly ever fit on a screen. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For this website, I currently want to review my game library as an extension of my titlecard gaming wiki. I want to implement a masonry
          layout somewhere and use responsive design for both desktop and mobile screens.

        <h3>YouTube</h3>
        <a class="link icon_move" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKxYqJ8ooghifoNTmtlcY1w"><img class="icon_size" src="images/youtube_icon.png" alt="YouTube Icon"></a>
        <p class="shorten">
          I have a YouTube channel that I created in 2016 and have uploaded intermittently to over time. It has over 300 
          videos mostly about gaming, but recently I have uploaded more tutorials and software related content. I'm quite happy that
          I made it because it is a nice hobby and I enjoy creating videos when I get round to recording and editing them. A long time
          ago I watched channels like Jacksepticeye and then theRadBrad constantly, as they are quite humorous, thorough, and generally
          skilled. I'm away from my ageing gaming computer while I study, so I might get a better setup in the future. My channel is 
          small but I'm very glad to have a subscriber base and viewership because it means my stuff is getting recognised and I have 
          entertained people. :) So, thank you guys for sticking around!

        <h3>GitHub</h3>
        <a class="link icon_move_2" href="https://github.com/ArbaazPatwari"><img class="icon_size" src="images/github_icon.png" alt="GitHub Icon"></a>
        <p class="shorten">
          I created a GitHub account in 2021 which I use to backup and showcase my important coding projects. I felt like showcasing them
          because I can show my range of skills as a developer and perhaps provide inspiration to others who are getting into code. It
          displays 5 coding projects currently but I aim to expand this greatly, and include this one as number 6 I think! I am quite 
          happy with my website project which I called titlecard (written in HTML, CSS, JS) and game project called Zone of Malice 
          (written in C#). I used a lot of code as reference from various channels and random websites, some of which I have credited 
          on a page called 'Resources' in my coding projects wiki - but I changed the content to fit my/ the correct style so it was 
          personalised and modified. When I started programming I learnt from coding teachers like Kevin Powell and Amigoscode for 
          guidance and good practices. Not many people follow me on GitHub, but that's ok lol.

        <h3>More about me</h3>
        <a class="link icon_move_3" href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/ArbaazPatwari/"><img class="icon_size" src="images/pinterest_icon.png" alt="Pinterest Icon"></a>
        <p class="shorten">
          There's not much else I produce on the internet publicly, other than grouping some images together in Pinterest. I'm a guy
          who is definitely not normal but I am curious, quirky, and kind when it is suitable. I like computers, games, mechs and robots,
          sushi and samosas, my friends and family. And my favourite movie is Pacific Rim.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I'm continuing on with my studies and may contribute to this website, coding projects, or YouTube channel in my free time.
